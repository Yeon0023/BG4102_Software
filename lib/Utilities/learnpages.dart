      description:
          'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational or health consequences. It encompasses the conditions that some people refer to as alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, alcohol addiction, and the colloquial term, alcoholism. Considered a brain disorder, AUD can be mild, moderate, or severe.' +
              '\n\n' +
              'Lasting changes in the brain caused by alcohol misuse perpetuate AUD and make individuals vulnerable to relapse. The good news is that no matter how severe the problem may seem, evidence-based treatment with behavioral therapies, mutual-support groups, and/or medications can help people with AUD achieve and maintain recovery. According to a national survey, 14.1 million adults ages 18 and older (5.6 percent of this age group) had AUD in 2019. Among youth, an estimated 414,000 adolescents ages 12–17 (1.7 percent of this age group2) had AUD during this timeframe.',

      description: 'Having even a couple symptoms—which you might not see as trouble signs—can signal a drinking problem. It helps to know the signs so you can make a change early. Doctors diagnose AUD when a patient has two or more of the symptoms listed below. AUD can be mild (the presence of two to three symptoms), moderate (the presence of four to five symptoms), or severe (the presence of six or more symptoms). See if you recognize any of these symptoms—or others, such as feeling low, dysphoria, or malaise—in yourself. And dont worry—even if you have symptoms, you can take steps to reduce your risk of AUD and other alcohol-related consequences.' +

If you do have any symptoms, then alcohol may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more urgent the need for change. A healthcare professional can look at the number, pattern, and severity of symptoms to see whether AUD is present and help you decide the best course of action.',

          '\n\n' +
          '. Detox and withdrawal. Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that is medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.' +
          '\n\n' +

Drinking coffee to “sober up” may make you feel more awake, but it may also make you more inclined to make the mistake of trying to drive while under the influence. Combining alcohol with other drugs can also have adverse effects.' +
